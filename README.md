# Systematic conservation planning for intermittent streams
This repo contains codes developed to apply systematic conservation planning to identify priority refuges in intermittent stream networks for biodiversity conservation.
To represent biodiversity, 25 native freshwater fish species were considered in the study area - south east Queensland.
This work is part of my PhD thesis and was funded by the China Scholarship Council and Griffith University.
